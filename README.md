# redux-store

## Challenge:
Your challenge this week is to refactor the e-commerce platform from Activity 26Links to an external site. so that it uses ReduxLinks to an external site.. You won’t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but you will need to read through the Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. We’ve provided some guidelines to point you in the right direction in the Getting Started section below.

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app’s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
